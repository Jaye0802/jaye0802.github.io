I was born at a very young age. Currently, I am a student, a quantitative researcher, a macroeconomics enthusiast, a lover of cinematic art, a backpacker, a surfer, a Lagree fan, a tennis beginner, and a devoted admirer of Camus. I’m striving to balance coursework, academic research, work, and my 87 hobbies (though I’m not exactly a big fan of the whole MULTITASKING concept). Welcome to my little corner where I share stories, insights, and observations in life!
